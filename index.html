        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <h2>Sustainable Peace</h2>
        <p>We have a professor on campus that needs help using Python to crunch data concerning "Sustainable Peace."  This project uses matplotlib, numpy and scipy to create graphs.  If you've any experience with Python and their math libraries, come join.</p>
        
        <h2><a href="https://github.com/QuicNYC/Flushing-Underground-Map" target="_blank">Flushing Food Map</a></h2>
        <p>The Flushing Chamber of Commerce asked if we can create buttons that apply filters to our existing data.  Additionally, he would like to have the data be updated every day or week using the Yelp API.  PHP and JavaScript are both used for this project.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/QuicNYC/dev.quic.nyc" target="_blank">Quic.NYC</a></h2>
        <p>Yup, that's us. We need to add a feature that saves student applications to our server/database.  PHP is used for this project.</p>
        
        <h2>Building Temperature Maps</h2>
        <p>We want to use the data collected here to create GUI (map) that shows what rooms at CUNY John Jay are at the right temperature and which ones are too hot/cold.  This information will be useful to building contractors.</p>
        
        <h2>Grayscale (<a href="https://github.com/QuicNYC/grayscale-web-app" target="_blank">Web</a>/Android) App</h2>
        <p>This app would be used by the colorblind.  Kevin built a working web demo <a href="http://kevinramsunder.com/grayscale-web-app/" target="_blank">here</a> that needs some visual work and a 'save' button.</p>
        <p>Additionally, there is interest in creating an Android app that would filter the screen (make it gray, block blue light) at the press of a button.  Basically, something similar to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kovit.p.filteryourscreen&hl=en" target="_blank">this app</a>.</p>
        
        <h2><a href="https://github.com/QuicNYC/WebDevCurriculum" target="_blank">Web Development Course</a></h2>
        <p>I am creating a curriculum for a web development course.  Please view the page and help add to the curriculum.</p>
        
        <h2>Your Project</h2>
        <p>If you have an idea for a project, please tell us.  Let's build it!</p>
        
        <h1>Study Groups</h1>
        <p>It was mentioned at one of the meetings that we should start learning different things.  I believe it was Ken that mentioned he wanted to learn Machine Learning.</p>
        <p>We can create study groups to tackle these subjects by ourselves.  Coursera has a machine learning course starting September 15th (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/" target="_blank">CLICK</a>).</p>
        <p>If not machine learning, browse the other courses (or any other course at edX, Udacity, etc.).  Let's learn outside of the classroom as well as in the classroom.</p>
